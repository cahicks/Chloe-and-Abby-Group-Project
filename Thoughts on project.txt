For our assignment, I think we need to get together and decide which parts of the MLB data is relevant. 
For example, we know that the teams are going to be important in determining the cities the players are from, but their jersey number probably isnâ€™t as important.
I think we should look at the batting averages as well because we could see how skilled the player are based on the city they are from. 
And maybe certain cities produce more talented players?
